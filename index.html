            <section class="about" data-label="About me">
                <p>
                    I am 29 years old, I was born in Ukraine, but currently I'm a permanent resident of the United States.
                    I can speak English, Russian and Ukrainian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like photography and art in all forms as well as trevelling,
                    discovering for myself new cultures, traditions, mindsets and amazing views of the nature and architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a master's degree in Economics, but my heart always belonged to mathematics and exact sciences. Later on I got carried
                    away with programming as the apogee of digital art, mathematics and pure logic. I enjoy the most that every time you take
                    up some work, it is an opportunity to create something new and not ordinary.

                                The project was initiated by the Norwegian Research Council and supported by the Ministry of Health and the Health Authorities
                                of Norway. It is a cloud-based, authoring suite enabling the construction of a wide array of patient-centered decision support
                                systems including health and treatment optimization. The platform was used to construct a health optimization system enabling
                                patients with bipolar disorder, their healthcare providers and caretakers to collaborate on the assessment, selection, adjustment
                                and systematic follow-up of treatment use and lifestyle measures.

                            Vladislav worked full time on the "Demos" project from 2014 to 2017.

                            surpassed expectations. He has been a reliable, creative, diligent and good-humored team member, with very good programming
                            and problem-solving skills. In the team, he has been a stable force, is on good terms and collaborates well with all team
                            members, and is one of the main contributors to a positive atmosphere. He works well under pressure and has very useful abilities
                            in finding new and creative solutions. I have been fully satisfied with his work and can recommend him whole-heartedly.
